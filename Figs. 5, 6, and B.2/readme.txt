Scripts to replicate Figs. 5, 6, and B.2
	The data (10 datasets) are generated by high_dim_gamma_create_data.py
	The script high_dim_gamma_experiment.py applies various estimation methods to these generated datasets and save the results.
	plot_high_dim_experiments_main_text.py produces Fig. 5
	plot_high_dim_experiments_appendix.py produces Fig. B.2
	plot_high_dim_by_num_projs.py produces Fig. 6
